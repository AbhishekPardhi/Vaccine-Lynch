# Vaccine-Lynch
Here's my First 3d game named Vaccine Lynch developed by me and other members of my team using Unity Engine. There is an apocalypse in the city in this game, where you(Humanoid)
have spawned to stop the infection from spreading. Meanwhile, you have to make sure you don’t get infected by zombies and make sure your health doesn’t go down to 0. Use Vaccines
to kill the infection. Use vaccines wisely as there is only a limited number of vaccines available right now. Watch your taskbar to know about all of your tasks.
